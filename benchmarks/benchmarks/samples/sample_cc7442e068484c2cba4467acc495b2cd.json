This is evident from the `get_embeddings` function in the `backend/word_vectors.py` file, specifically line 27, where the embedding is converted to a list and then serialized using `pickle.dumps` before being stored in Redis. When the embeddings are retrieved from Redis, they are deserialized using `pickle.loads`, which would return them to their original list of floats format (see line 29).",
