    "message_edit": "Huggingface models are cached using the Transformers library, which automatically handles the caching process. When you use a model from Huggingface for the first time, the Transformers library downloads the model and its associated files (like configuration and tokenizer files) and stores them in a cache directory on your local machine. Subsequent uses of the same model will load the model from the cache, avoiding the need to re-download the files.\n\nBy default, the cache directory is located at `~/.cache/huggingface/transformers` on Unix-based systems and at `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.cache\\huggingface\\transformers` on Windows. You can also customize the cache location by setting the `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` environment variable.\n\nThe caching mechanism involves checking for the existence of the model in the cache directory before attempting to download it. If the model is not found in the cache, it is downloaded and saved there. If the model is already in the cache, the library will use the cached version.\n\nNo code changes are required for this explanation.",
