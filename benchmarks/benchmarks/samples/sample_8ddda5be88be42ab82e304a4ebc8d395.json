    "message_edit": "When you click the Magic Wand button in the frontend application, a series of actions and data exchanges occur between the frontend and the backend. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Frontend - Button Click**: The user clicks the Magic Wand button in the `Navigation` component within the `frontend/src/navigation/Navigation.js` file.\n\n2. **Frontend - Event Handler**: The click event triggers the `toggleMagicWand` function that is passed as a prop to the `MagicWandButton` component. This function is defined in the `App` component within the `frontend/src/App.js` file.\n\n3. **Frontend - Set Loading State**: The `toggleMagicWand` function first sets the `isLoading` state to `true` to indicate that an asynchronous operation is starting.\n\n4. **Frontend - Prepare API Call**: The function prepares the arguments for the API call, which includes the current search terms, search history, and a flag indicating whether to reset the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) ID to \"default\" or not.\n\n5. **Frontend - API Call**: The function makes an asynchronous POST request to the `/api/set_pca` endpoint on the backend server, sending the prepared arguments in the request body.\n\n6. **Backend - Receive Request**: The backend Flask server in `backend/app.py` receives the request at the `/api/set_pca` endpoint.\n\n7. **Backend - Authentication**: The `@token_required` decorator on the `set_pca` function checks for a valid authentication token in the request headers. If the token is missing or invalid, it returns an error response.\n\n8. **Backend - Validate and Process**: If the token is valid, the `set_pca` function validates the input words and processes the request. It decides whether to reset the PCA ID or generate a new one based on the provided words.\n\n9. **Backend - Generate PCA**: The backend generates a new PCA or retrieves the default PCA and applies it to the corpus, which includes the Oxford 3000 words, any search history, and the current search terms.\n\n10. **Backend - Return Response**: The backend constructs a response with the new PCA ID and the coordinates of all words in the corpus after applying the PCA transformation. This response is sent back to the frontend.\n\n11. **Frontend - Update State**: Upon receiving the response, the `toggleMagicWand` function updates the `pcaId` state with the new PCA ID and the `corpus` state with the new coordinates for each word. It also sets the `isLoading` state to `false` to indicate that the operation has completed.\n\n12. **Frontend - Re-render**: The `App` component and its child components re-render to reflect the updated state. The `Canvas` component will display the dots (words) in their new positions according to the updated PCA coordinates.\n\n13. **Frontend - User Feedback**: The Magic Wand button's appearance and behavior may change based on the new `isWandActive` state, which is determined by the `isLoading` state and the length of the search terms.\n\nThroughout this process, the frontend manages the application state and user interface, while the backend handles data processing and authentication. The PCA transformation effectively changes the visualization of the word vectors in the 3D space, allowing the user to explore different perspectives of the data.",
