    "message_edit": "Given the setup of your environment and the type of data being stored in Redis, one viable option to inspect Redis data while your site is deployed would be to use a Redis management tool that provides a web interface. This would allow you to connect to your Redis instance securely and perform various operations such as viewing, adding, editing, and deleting keys, as well as monitoring the performance of your Redis server.\n\nOne such tool is RedisInsight by Redis Labs, which is a free and powerful GUI for Redis. It offers features like:\n\n- Browser tool: To visualize and manage your Redis data with built-in support for most Redis data types.\n- Profiler: To analyze command latency and frequency.\n- Slowlog: To identify and troubleshoot slow operations.\n- Cluster management: If you're using Redis in cluster mode.\n\nTo set up RedisInsight with your current deployment, you would need to:\n\n1. Install RedisInsight on a machine that can access your Redis instance. This could be your local machine if you have a secure connection to your production environment or a server within the same network as your Redis instance.\n\n2. Configure RedisInsight to connect to your Redis instance. You would need to provide the host (which, based on your `redis_client.py`, is \"redis\"), port (default is 6379), and any authentication details if your Redis instance is secured.\n\n3. Ensure that your Redis instance is accessible from the machine where RedisInsight is installed. This might involve configuring network rules or setting up an SSH tunnel for secure access.\n\n4. Once connected, you can use RedisInsight to inspect the data. Given that your application stores pickled Python objects, you would need to unpickle the data within RedisInsight to inspect it in a human-readable format.\n\nThis approach would give you a comprehensive view of your Redis data and allow you to manage it effectively without making any changes to your application code or deployment configuration. It's also a non-intrusive method, meaning it won't affect the running of your site or require downtime to implement.",
