    "message_edit": "The camera movement when you click on a dot in the `frontend/src/App.js` file is not directly handled within the `select` function. However, the `select` function updates the state of the application, which in turn can trigger a re-render and potentially cause the camera to move if the camera's behavior is tied to the state.\n\nHere's how the camera movement might be indirectly triggered:\n\n1. The `select` function updates the `corpus` state by toggling the `selected` property of the clicked dot's word.\n2. If the `selected` property of a word changes, the `searchTerm` state may also be updated.\n3. The `Camera` component in `frontend/src/Camera.js` receives `selectedCorpus` as a prop, which is derived from the `corpus` state in `App.js`.\n4. The `Camera` component has a `useEffect` hook that watches for changes in `selectedCorpus`. When `selectedCorpus` changes, the hook calculates a new camera position and target based on the bounding box of the selected words.\n5. The `useFrame` hook from `@react-three/fiber` is used to smoothly interpolate the camera's position and the controls' target to the new values calculated by the `useEffect` hook.\n\nThe camera movement is therefore a result of the state changes in `App.js` that are propagated to the `Camera` component, which then calculates and applies the new camera position and target.",
