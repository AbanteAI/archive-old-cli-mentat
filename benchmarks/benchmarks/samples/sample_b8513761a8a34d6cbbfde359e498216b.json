    "message_prompt": "How is rate limiting implemented?",
    "message_edit": "Rate limiting in the provided Nginx configuration is implemented using the `limit_req_zone` and `limit_conn_zone` directives. Here's a summary of how it's set up:\n\n1. `limit_req_zone`: This directive defines a rate limit zone called \"req_limit_per_ip\" that allows a maximum of 5 requests per second with a burst of 10 requests. The zone is stored in memory and uses the client IP address as the key to track the rate of incoming requests.\n\n2. `limit_conn_zone`: This directive defines a connection limit zone called \"conn_limit_per_ip\" that allows a maximum of 10 concurrent connections per IP address.\n\n3. Application of rate limits in server blocks:\n   - For the `/api` location block (lines 40-50), the rate limit is applied using `limit_req` and `limit_conn` directives, which reference the previously defined zones. The `limit_req` directive specifies that the burst size is 10 requests and the `nodelay` option is used, which means that excessive requests are processed immediately instead of being delayed.\n   - Similarly, for the `/` location block (lines 52-62), the same rate limits are applied to the traffic directed to the frontend.\n\nThe rate limiting is thus designed to protect both the API and the main website from excessive traffic by limiting the number of requests and connections that a single client IP can make.",
