This is done conditionally based on whether the parser is configured to provide line numbers.\n\nHere is the relevant code snippet from the `mentat/code_feature.py` file:\n\n```python\n143:        # Get file lines\n144:        file_lines = code_file_manager.read_file(self.path)\n145:        for i, line in enumerate(file_lines):\n146:            if self.interval.contains(i + 1):\n147:                if parser.provide_line_numbers():\n148:                    code_message.append(\n149:                        f\"{i + parser.line_number_starting_index()}:{line}\"\n150:                    )\n151:                else:\n152:                    code_message.append(f\"{line}\")\n```\n\nIn this snippet, line numbers are inserted into the code message string at lines 148-149. If the parser is set to provide line numbers, each line of the code message is prefixed with the line number and a colon, followed by the actual line of code. The line number is calculated by adding the loop index `i` to the `parser.line_number_starting_index()`.",
