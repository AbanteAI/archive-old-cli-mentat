    "message_prompt": "I want to store timestamps in a way that's concise, human readable and lets me setup and execute queries quickly (like calculating the number of days in some range) efficiently in a number of different languges. Give me 3 options.",
    "message_edit": "To store timestamps in a concise, human-readable format that allows for efficient querying and calculations, you can consider the following three options:\n\n1. **ISO 8601 Format**: This is an international standard for date and time representations. It is both human-readable and easily parsed by machines. It looks like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` for UTC times or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM` for times with a timezone offset. Most programming languages have built-in support for parsing and formatting ISO 8601 dates, which makes it a good choice for cross-language compatibility.\n\n2. **Unix Timestamp**: This is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970). It is not human-readable without conversion but is extremely concise and allows for very efficient date range calculations because you're simply dealing with integer values. Almost all programming languages provide functions to convert Unix timestamps to human-readable dates and vice versa.\n\n3. **Custom Compact Format**: You could define a custom format that is both human-readable and concise, such as `YYYYMMDDHHMM`. This format removes separators and reduces the precision to minutes. It's less standard than ISO 8601, but it can be more space-efficient. You would need to write custom parsing and formatting logic, but this is generally straightforward in most languages.\n\nHere is a brief summary of each option in terms of human readability, conciseness, and query efficiency:\n\n- **ISO 8601 Format**: Human-readable, standard, good for cross-language compatibility, and precise to the second. It is less concise than Unix timestamps but more so than most other human-readable formats.\n- **Unix Timestamp**: Not human-readable without conversion, but very concise and efficient for calculations. It is widely supported across different programming languages.\n- **Custom Compact Format**: Human-readable and more concise than ISO 8601, but requires custom parsing logic. It is less standard and may not be as precise if you need to store seconds or timezone information.\n\nEach option has its trade-offs, and the best choice will depend on the specific requirements of your application, such as the need for human readability, the level of precision required, and the programming languages you are using.",
