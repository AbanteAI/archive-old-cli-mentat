    "message_edit": "The `loading_multiplier` is a parameter used to control the progress reporting of long-running asynchronous operations, particularly when interacting with external APIs or performing computations that involve machine learning models. It is a floating-point number that typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the percentage of completion of a task.\n\nHere's a summary of its function and current utilization:\n\nFunction:\n1. The `loading_multiplier` is used to calculate the progress percentage to be displayed to the user during operations that may take a significant amount of time, such as fetching embeddings or filtering code features using a language model.\n2. It helps provide feedback to the user on the progress of the operation, which can improve the user experience by indicating that the system is actively working on the task.\n3. The multiplier is applied to the progress value before it is sent to the stream for display. For example, if the `loading_multiplier` is set to 0.5 and the operation is halfway done, the reported progress would be 25% (0.5 * 50%).\n\nCurrent Utilization:\n1. In `DefaultFilter` (mentat/feature_filters/default_filter.py), the `loading_multiplier` is passed to the `EmbeddingSimilarityFilter` and `LLMFeatureFilter` constructors. It is then used to report the progress of embedding similarity scoring and feature selection tasks.\n2. In `LLMFeatureFilter` (mentat/feature_filters/llm_feature_filter.py), the `loading_multiplier` is used when sending progress updates to the stream during the call to the language model API (`llm_api_handler.call_llm_api`). The progress is reported before and after the API call, with the multiplier determining the proportion of the progress bar to fill.\n3. In `EmbeddingSimilarityFilter` (mentat/feature_filters/embedding_similarity_filter.py), the `loading_multiplier` is used when calling the `get_feature_similarity_scores` function from `mentat.embeddings`. It controls the progress reporting during the fetching of embeddings and calculation of similarity scores.\n\nIn summary, the `loading_multiplier` is a mechanism for providing visual feedback on the progress of operations that may take time, enhancing the user experience by keeping them informed about the ongoing process.",
