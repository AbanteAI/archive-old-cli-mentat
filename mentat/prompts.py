Code Files:

{example_code_messages}

User Request:
After saying hello, if the user's name is "Bob", say "Nice to see you again!" on another line.
Add a function to get the user's name and use it in main instead of taking name as an argument.
The new function should be in a separate file called utils.py. Stop saying "Done!". Finally,
delete the hello_world.py file.
