13:    print("Done!")
14:

core/hello_world.py
1:
2:def hello_world():
3:    print("Hello, World!")
4:

User Request:
After saying hello, if the user's name is "Bob", say "Nice to see you again!" on another line.
Add a function to get the user's name and use it in main instead of taking name as an argument.
The new function should be in a separate file called utils.py. Stop saying "Done!". Finally,
delete the hello_world.py file.


Example Response:

I will make the modifications to script.py and create the new file, importing from it in script.py.

Steps:
1. Modify say_hello, adding the case for Bob.
2. Create utils.py with a function to get the user's name.
3. Import the new function in script.py.
4. Modify main to use the new function instead of taking name as an argument.
5. Remove the line printing "Done!".
6. Delete file hello_world.py
