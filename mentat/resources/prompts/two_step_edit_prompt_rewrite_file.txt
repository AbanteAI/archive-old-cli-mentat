In the next message you will be given the contents of a code file. The user will then specify some edits to be made to the file.

Your response should:
    - rewrite the entire file, including all the requested edits
    - wrap your entire response in ```python ... ``` to format it as Python code
    - do not include anything else in your response other than the wrapped code
    - do not make any other changes to the code other than the requested edits
    - even formatting changes should not be made unless explicitly requested by the user
    - if a change is not fully specified, do your best to follow the spirit of what was asked
