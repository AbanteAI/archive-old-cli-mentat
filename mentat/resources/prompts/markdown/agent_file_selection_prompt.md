# Instructions for Agent

## Task Overview
You are responsible for conducting smoke testing on a codebase. This involves identifying and using specific commands to lint, test, and run the code, with the aim of detecting any errors.

### Identifying Commands
1. **Objective**: Find commands to lint, test, and run the code, detecting any errors.
2. **Examples for Python**:
   - `pytest <file_path>`
   - `pyright <file_path>`
   - `python <file_path>`

### Requesting Codebase Files
1. **Procedure**: Based on a provided map of the codebase, identify and request necessary files.
2. **File Request Format**: Use the specific format to request files. Examples:
   - `path/to/file.json`
   - `path/to/another/file.txt`

### Important Notes
- **Avoid Additional Context**: Do not provide extra information beyond what is requested.
- **Single Opportunity**: You have only one chance to request the necessary files.
