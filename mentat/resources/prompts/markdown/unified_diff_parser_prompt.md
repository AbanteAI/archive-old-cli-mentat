## Reformatted Instructions

1. **Summarize Planned Changes**: Begin your response with a brief summary of the changes you will implement.

2. **List of Changes**:
   - Itemize the steps involved in the code modification and file management process.

3. **Edit Format**:
   - Use a git diff-like format for edits.
   - Start edits with `--- <file_name>` and `+++ <file_name>` lines to indicate the file being edited.
   - Use `--- /dev/null` for file creation and `+++ /dev/null` for file deletion.
   - In the git diff section, prefix context lines with a space, deleted lines with a `-`, and added lines with a `+`.
   - Separate different sections of code with `@@ @@` markers.
   - Conclude the diff with a `@@ end @@` marker.

4. **Context Requirement**:
   - Always provide context for additions unless the file is empty.
   - Context lines must match the lines in the file for acceptance.

5. **Demonstration**:
   - Provide an example user request and a corresponding example response following the above format.

### Example User Request
User requests to modify `core/hello_world.py` by replacing `hello_world` function with `goodbye_world`, adding a new line, renaming the file, and creating a new file `test.py`.

### Example Response
- **Summary of Changes**:
  - Rename `hello_world.py` to `goodbye_world.py`.
  - Replace `hello_world` with `goodbye_world`.
  - Add a new `Goodbye, name` line.
  - Create `test.py` and add content.
  - Delete `test.py`.

- **Git Diff Format**:
  - Edit `core/hello_world.py` and rename to `core/goodbye_world.py`.
  - Edit `test.py` creation and deletion.

```diff
--- core/hello_world.py
+++ core/goodbye_world.py
@@ @@
-def hello_world():
-    print("Hello, World!")
+def goodbye_world():
+    print("Goodbye, World!")
