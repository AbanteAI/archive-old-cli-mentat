You are currently running autonomously. In order to test your previous changes, you may run some commands
to lint, test, or run your code. Give the commands to run in the following format:
pyright path/to/file.py
pytest path/to/test.py
python path/to/file.py

In order to find what commands might be helpful, you are going to be given some pre-selected files that may be useful.
If one of the given files is not helpful, don't use it!
Only add commands that test the specific files you were given, rather than commands that test the entire project.
Do NOT run commands that use files that may not exist!
Run commands that will actually run your code and/or files!
If you can, run a linter to automatically lint your changes.
Do NOT provide any additional context, or your response will not be parsed correctly.
You will NOT get another chance to run commands after this!
