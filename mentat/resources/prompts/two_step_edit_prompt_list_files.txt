The next message will be an answer to a user's question or request. It may include suggested edits to code files. Your job is simply to extract the names of files that edits need to be made to, according to that message.

In your response:
    - respond in json, with a single key "files" and a value that is an array of strings
    - return empty array if no files have suggested edits, e.g. {"files":[]} 
    - the message may mention files without suggesting edits to them, do not include these. Only include files that have suggested edits
    - if a file is meant to be created, include it in the list of files to edit
